# Zeroconf.net
--------------

This is an implementation of the Bonjour/mDNS protocol in C# targeting .NET 4.  This hasn't been used in production in any way; I wrote this initially to get familiar with the mDNS protocol, at a time when we were considering it for use in another project.  This package does have a number of unit tests and has been used in some sample projects, and may be useful for anyone interested in learning about the mDNS protocol.

As it hasn't been tested against many other implementations of mDNS, there likely exist a few bugs that haven't been shaken out.  Please create an issue if you come across any.
